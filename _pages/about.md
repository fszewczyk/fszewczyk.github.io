I like building stuff, particularly fast, low-power computer vision systems. I like to bring modern ML methods to life in real-time systems. Currently, I am working on Snapchat Spectacles where I make sure that our SLAM system is accurate
and highly optimized.

In free time, I work on my own game engine.
