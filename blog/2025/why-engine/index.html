So far, it’s been highly effective, because implementing anything from scratch got me a decent fundamental understanding; I got to see how it works in practice, and in the end I had a working demo that I could show to friends and potential employers.</p> <p>This worked well for some time. However, after the 8471th time reimplementing a simple ImGui UI, small CMake build and basic C++ patterns, I got quite tired of the boilerplate work involved. Originally, I wanted to just abstract the shared functionality into some library or a repository template. However, I’d still end up with a collection of small, mostly useless applications that fail to teach me proper software design, simply due to their limited scope and scale.</p> <p>Finally, the idea of building a game engine popped up. Literally any technical concept I would ever want to learn could be simply a feature in the engine:</p> <ol> <li> <strong>Want to learn concurrency?</strong> Build a parallel job system.</li> <li> <strong>Want to learn networking?</strong> Implement multiplayer.</li> <li> <strong>Want to learn a new language?</strong> Add scripting support for that language.</li> <li> <strong>Want to learn about compilers or interpreters?</strong> Make your own scripting language.</li> <li> <strong>Want to learn AI?</strong> Maybe the NPCs will finally behave naturally.</li> </ol> <p>The list goes on. I am not able to think of a single concept, at least vaguely related to computer science, that does not fit into this. The above argument aligns with the words of a very wise man:</p> <blockquote> <p>Any real-time program responding to frequent inputs from the environment, is a game engine from a software engineering perspective - Me, 2025</p> </blockquote> <p>But that’s a topic for a different post.</p> <h1 id="the-what">The What</h1> <p>So a game engine it is. I am aiming for a large project with asset management, parallel job system, good-looking and fast rendering, physics, etc. It will also have a fully capable GUI. As I progress, I will be able to come up with a single, well-defined feature, <em>terrain editor</em> for instance, read papers and watch talks on the topic, and finally sit down and deploy it within a reasonable time-frame, without many obstacles, easily tying it into the existing functionality of the engine. If I manage to do that, I will have successfully fulfilled the goal of <a href="#the-why"><em>The Why</em></a>, the game engine will become my go-to framework for all new project ideas I may have.</p> <p>I have one main priority when designing the core: developer velocity at late stages of the project. I wanted to make sure that whatever I lay out at the beginning will allow me to build new functionality fast and that the usage of the core functionality will be so simple that even a drunk monkey, that hasn’t looked at the code base in six months, will be able to quickly pick up the existing patterns. I want to make it difficult to write bad code. I’m mentioning this just because some parts of the engine may seem overengineered, given the limited functionality. That’s usually on purpose.</p> <p>As a side effect, I would like the very core of the project to become a real-time processing framework that can be used for many other things other than games. For instance, I can imagine building a fully functional and highly performant robotics control pipeline using my ECS and job system. But that’s a problem for later.</p> <p>The development is public on GitHub under the name <a href="https://github.com/fszewczyk/shkyera-engine" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">shkyera-engine</a>.</p> <h1 id="the-how">The How</h1> <p>C++ has been my weapon of choice for some time already. This stays the same for the core part of the engine. Currently, I do not care much about modern graphics programming so I will rely on OpenGL. Until my project becomes unbearably complex, I will stay away from package managers and will rely solely on git submodules for third-party libraries and plain CMake for building. I do not have a Windows machine, so I will only target Linux and MacOS, at least for now.</p> <h1 id="the-plan">The Plan</h1> <p>In future posts, I’ll give a detailed overview of the very core of the project, the infrastructure I will use to build new “mini-projects”, learn new things, and do it fast. Hopefully, it will be comprehensive enough to give a holistic view of what I’m trying to build, it will be legible enough to help others build their own software, and it will act as a documentation for the engine itself. I’ll also do my best to keep it light and not let it become a super-heavy technical reference.</p> </div> </article> </div> </div> <footer class="sticky-bottom mt-5" role="contentinfo"> <div class="container"> © Copyright 2025 Franciszek Szewczyk.
